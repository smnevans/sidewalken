Maciej Ceglowski on privacy in the age of surveillance capital &nbsp;---

> This requires us to talk about a different kind of privacy, one that we haven't needed to give a name to before. For the purposes of this essay, I'll call it 'ambient privacy'--the understanding that there is value in having our everyday interactions with one another remain outside the reach of monitoring, and that the small details of our daily lives should pass by unremembered. What we do at home, work, church, school, or in our leisure time does not belong in a permanent record. Not every conversation needs to be a deposition.
