Unlike Netflix, there is no way to search the iTunes catalog for movies with subtitles or audio in a certain language. The only way I can find movies with Japanese subs is to open each one, cross my fingers and scroll down the sometimes improbably long and sometimes surprisingly short list of subtitle languages.

This is a list of ones I have found.

- The Favourite
- Blade Runner: The Final Cut
- Blade Runner 2049
- Captain America: Civil War
- Men in Black: International
