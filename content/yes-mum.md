While we were watching the first episode of Bodyguard, my wife asked me why everyone kept calling their bosses "Mum". I explained that they were actually saying "Ma'am", but every time it came up again for the entire rest of the season, I couldn't help but hear it as "Mum" myself, which lent an air of absurdity to the whole thing.
