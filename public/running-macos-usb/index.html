  <h2>Running Mac OS from a USB drive - a cautionary tale</h2>
  </header>

           <p>A few months ago the SSD in my ancient MacBook Air began to falter. The sensor that told my Mac the SSD existed was intermittently failing, so I could use it for a while, then it would freeze as if the system drive had been unplugged.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t keen buying a new one until Apple sorted out its <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/02/dhh-macbook-keyboards">keyboard woes</a>, and the prospect of installing a new SSD myself was rather daunting, so my brain came up with what seemed like a brilliant and cheap stop-gap workaround &mdash; install the OS onto a USB drive and run the system from that. My thinking (if it can be called that) was that a USB drive is basically a kind of SSD anyway. I knew it would be slower because it would be limited by the speed of the USB bus, but I figured it&rsquo;d be worth a shot and would keep me going until Apple got its act together.</p>

<p>My idea turned out to be neither brilliant nor cheap. I was able to get it up and running after a lot of futzing about, but I was plagued by spinning beachballs, freezes and random crashes multiple times a day, even when I was running just a text editor. After a month of putting up with that, I ended up ordering a new SSD from <a href="[https://www.upgradeable.com.au]" title="Upgradable.com">Upgradable.com</a> for about $150, which is about three times more than I spent on the USB drive, but the SSD was twice as big and, more importantly, actually works. Installing it was a doddle and took no more about twenty minutes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d learnt my lesson from past cheapskate shenanigans, but it seems not. On the bright side, it seems that Apple has a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/05/macbook-scissor-keyboards">new keyboard</a> ready to be introduced sometime next year, so when this MacBook Air finally gives up the ghost, I hope I&rsquo;ll feel less trepidation about getting a new one.</p>
